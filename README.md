The program reads all the data from the csv files in the /resources/csv folder and structures it and records everything
in the objects. Then the recorded users are shown in the console. Then the calculations are made and the graphs are
generated and saved in the /resources/img folder. Then the html emails are generated and sent for each user in the
customer_data table.
